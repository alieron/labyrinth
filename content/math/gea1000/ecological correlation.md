### Summary
Ecological fallacy
- using ecological correlation to make predictions about the individual

Atomistic fallacy
- using individual correlation to make predictions about the grouped averages

[Overgeneralisation](/labyrinth/notes/math/gea1000/design_of_experiments#^08aeba)
- extendind the correlation to outside of the population

### Concept
Ecological correlation
- scatter plot is of grouped averages instead of individual data points
- may not have the same trend as individual correlation
