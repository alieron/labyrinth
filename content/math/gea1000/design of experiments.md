### Summary
Changes of [univariate](/labyrinth/notes/math/gea1000/univariate_analysis) summary statistics, and [bivariate](/labyrinth/notes/math/gea1000/bivariate_analysis) r and m 
$$
\begin{array}{c | c | c | c | c}
Change \ to \ all \ values & \bar{x}, \ median, \ mode & SD,\ IQR & Var & r, \ m \\
\hline
+c & + c & no \ change & no \ change & no \ change\\
\times k & \times k & \times |k| & \times k ^2 & no \ change \\
\end{array}
$$

Var - variance, average suqared deviation from the mean
SD - standard deviation, spread about the mean
COV - coefficient of variation, degree of spread relative to mean
$$
\begin{align*}
SD = \sqrt{ Var } \\
\\
COV = \frac{SD}{\bar{x}}
\end{align*}
$$

### Concept
Types of variables
- Categorical Nominal
- Categorical Ordinal
- Numerical Discrete
- Numerical Continuous

Probability sampling methods
- Simple Random
- Systematic (interval)
- Stratified Random (proportion from each strata)
- Cluster

Consequencs of non-probability sampling
- Selection Bias
- Non-response Bias

Criteria for Generalisability ^08aeba
- Sample Frame >= Target Pop
- Probability Sampling
- Sufficient Response Rate
- Accurate Data

Experimental Studies
- Treatment vs Control groups
- Blinding
	- Placebo
	- Double-blinding, both accessors and participants

Observational Studies
- Self-selecting
- Only provides evidence of association

#

##### Extra
Random Assignment -> proportional distribution of different characteristics between treatment and control, to [reduce confounding](/labyrinth/notes/math/gea1000/confounders)
Probability Sampling -> probability of being selected is known and non-zero
