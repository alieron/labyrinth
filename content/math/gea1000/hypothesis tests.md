### Summary
Steps:
1. Deteremine null($H_0$) and alternate($H_A$) hypotheses
	- must be mutually exclusive
	- $H_0$ - want to disprove, $H_{A}$ - want to prove
2. Choose significance level
	- Usually 5% or 0.05
3. Calculate p-value
	- Probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than out observation, in the direction of the alternate hypothesis, assuming the null is true
4. Conclude hypothesis test
	- if p-value \< significance -> reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_A$
	- if p-value \> significance -> inconclusive test, cannot reject $H_0$, but $H_0$ is not neccesarily true

### Concept
Hypothesis test
To decide whether the data is sufficient enough to reject a particular hypothesis about a population

Types
- t-test, for population mean
- chi-squared test, for association
